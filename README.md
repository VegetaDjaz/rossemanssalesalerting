# rossmansalesalerting

I failed to create an alerting system, for now I just have a prediction of the sales by stores, based on the past one. I was thinking about comparing them to the actual real one. The next step was to implement a linear regression model based on what I have read. I more or less had ideas of how to work on this problem, but processing the data properly was a pain for me, and I lost all my time on it and on reading about how to solve the problem ...
